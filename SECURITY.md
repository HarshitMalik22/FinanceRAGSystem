## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report a Security Issue

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

In your report, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any mitigations if known
- Your contact information

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

To help keep the Finance RAG System secure, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Never commit sensitive data** to version control
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Access tokens
   - Personal information

2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
   - Store sensitive values in `.env` files (added to `.gitignore`)
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control

3. **Keep dependencies up to date**
   - Regularly update your dependencies to include security patches
   - Use `npm audit` and `safety check` to identify vulnerabilities

4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
   - Only request the minimum permissions required
   - Use read-only tokens when possible

5. **Validate all user input**
   - Always validate and sanitize user input
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement proper CORS policies

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) for the latest minor version. We recommend always running the latest patch version of the Finance RAG System.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published in the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/FinanceRAGSystem/security/advisories) section of the repository.

## Responsible Disclosure Timeline

- **Time to first response**: 48 hours
- **Time to triage**: 3 business days
- **Time to patch**: 
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: Next scheduled release

## Security Configuration

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

When deploying the application, configure a strong Content Security Policy. Example CSP headers:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:;
```

### Security Headers

Recommended security headers for production:

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Example configuration for FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.middleware import Middleware
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app = FastAPI(middleware=[Middleware(SlowAPIRateLimiter, key_func=get_remote_address)])
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)
```

## Secure Development Lifecycle

1. **Threat Modeling**: Conduct threat modeling during design phase
2. **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
3. **Automated Testing**: Run security scans in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
5. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments
